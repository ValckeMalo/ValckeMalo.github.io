          Hello, my name is Valcke Malo, and I am a 4th-year student at
          Créajeux, a French school specializing in game development.<br>
          I am passionate about gameplay programming and tools creation, which have
          become my areas of focus during my studies.<br><br>
          Over the past few years, I’ve worked on several small-group production projects, gaining
          hands-on experience in designing and implementing engaging game mechanics.<br><br>
          Sharing knowledge and collaborating with like-minded individuals is something I deeply
          value, and I believe it is an integral part of growing as a developer.<br><br>
          I am currently seeking an internship opportunity where I can deepen my
          skills, contribute to innovative projects, and collaborate with a team of talented professionals.<br><br>
          Determined, curious, and passionate, I am ready to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the
          world of game development.
