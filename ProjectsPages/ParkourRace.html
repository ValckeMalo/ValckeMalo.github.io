                        Over the course of several weeks, I embarked on a project to learn Unreal Engine 5 by recreating the core gameplay of Fall Guys in a solo effort.<br>
                        This exercise was designed to explore the engine’s capabilities while building a fun and dynamic gameplay experience inspired by the chaotic charm of the original game.<br>

                <p>
                    The project focused on delivering key elements of Fall Guys, including:<br>
                    <br>
                    Trap and obstacle mechanics, such as spinning bars, falling platforms, and moving blocks, to challenge the player.<br>
                    A player-controlled character with physics-based movement and animations, ensuring a playful, responsive feel.<br>
                    Multiple maps, each with unique layouts and challenges, to keep gameplay fresh and engaging.<br>
                    The objective was to create a functional and entertaining prototype while mastering key Unreal Engine 5 tools and workflows.<br>

                    As the sole developer, I:<br>
                    <br>
                    Designed and implemented trap and obstacle systems, ensuring they interacted smoothly with player physics.<br>
                    Built a player character system with movement, jumping, and ragdoll-like physics to capture the chaotic fun of Fall Guys.<br>
                    Created maps with distinct challenges, leveraging Unreal Engine 5’s powerful level design tools to make environments visually and mechanically engaging.<br>

                        This project allowed me to dive deep into Unreal Engine 5, gaining hands-on experience with Blueprints, physics systems, and level design.<br>
                        By recreating the energetic and unpredictable gameplay of Fall Guys, I also improved my ability to balance mechanics for fun and fairness.<br>
